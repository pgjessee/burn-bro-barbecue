# Welcome to the Burn Bro Barbecue Application!

This application is a multi-functional restuarant management app that allows customers to order food, and restaurant managers and employees to operate the restaurant, such as adding more food to the food stock.

# Introduction and Features

The creation of this application was inspired by the Burn Co Barbecue restaurant, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma (hence the name Burn Bro Barbecue). Burn Co is known for its outstanding barbecue, in addition to historically only open for lunch and its long lines to receive your delcious food. Since Burn Co is only open for lunch, generating sales during that window are critically important, and emphasis should be placed on getting as many customers through the line as possible and minimize wait time. Further, it is advantageous for the restaurant to have advanced knowledge of how much food to prepare and cook prior to opening time.
